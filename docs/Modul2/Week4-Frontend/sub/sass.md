# SASS 
Syntactically Awesome StyleSheet (SASS) is a preprocessed scripting engine written in Ruby programming language. It allows us to make CSS in a more programmatic way with parameters.
This is a great advantage. Now we can change e.g. a colo theme throughout the whole application by just changing the value of a parameter.
