# Project period
The project period is 3 weeks. You will work in groups and use everything you learned on 3rd semester. The purpose of the semester project is to
- Give you a chance to work with the System development tools you have learned in the SYS period.
- Create an application using all the technologies, frameworks and practises that you have learned in the 3 periods of programming in the semester.
- Based on the project you will write a report that you will be examined in during the SYS exam.
- The code you produce in this period will give you training and routine that you will need for the programming exam, but will not be used directly in the programming exam.
