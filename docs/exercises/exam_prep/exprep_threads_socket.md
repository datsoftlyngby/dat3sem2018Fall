# Thread Programming and Non-blocking Java Servers
![](../media/image4.png)

### General part

Explain about Thread Programming including:
- When and why we will use Threads in our programs?
- Explain about the Race Condition Problem and ways to solve it in
    Java
- Explain how we can write reusable non-blocking Java Controls using
    Threads
- Explain about deadlocks, how to detect them and ways to solve the
    Deadlock Problem

Practical part
--------------

In this exercise we will simulate a large football stadium with many turnstiles that each updates a shared counter, for each turn on the turnstile.

![](../media/turnstile.png)

The turnstiles should use a Network Connection and TCP to update the shared counter.

*Implement a Java Based server that can handle n-turnstile clients without any lost updates.*

1.  Design a TCP server and a simple protocol where each turnstile initially reports that it is a Turnstile (to distinguish from Monitor-Clients, see next step), its id
(turnstile1-turnstile-n) and then reports an increment for each spectator that passes the turnstile

1.  Identify potential Race Condition Problems and handle
the problem(s).

2.  For this exercise you donâ€™t have to implement the turnstile-clients.
Use a few Telnet Clients to simulate the turnstiles.

3.  Extend the system, so A Monitor-Client can request the current total amount of spectators

4.  Change the example to make it possible to see the count from each turnstile

5.  *If you have time-1: Deploy your server to DigitalOcean and
demonstrate using this remote server*

6.  *If you have time-2: Write a simple client (Swing or Web-based) that can show the total amount of spectators*

**Hints:**

For part-1 (the protocol) it could be as simple as you have to send "things" in this order:
- **TURNSTYLE** (to signal that this client is a turnstile, this is sent only once)
- **T-1** (the id of this turnstyle, this is sent only once)
- **Count** (the value to update the shared counter with, sent as many times a necessary)

Feel free to come up with an alternative protocol.
