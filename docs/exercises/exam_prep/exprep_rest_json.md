# REST and JSON 
![](../media/image4.png)

### General part
- *Elaborate on some of the characteristics of REST, like: Stateless, Cacheable, Layered System, Uniform Interface etc.*

- *Explain about the topics Same Origin Policy and CORS and why/how they are relevant when calling REST services from an Ajax-call within a browser.*

- *Explain the benefit(s) from having a backend that exposes all data to clients via a REST-API*

- *Elaborate on how JSON or XML supports communication between subsystems, even when the subsystems are implemented on different platforms.*

### Practical part 
(You might need to add the gson dependency)

Use NetBeans to create a basic Maven Web Application for this exercise.
You don't need any "WEB" for part one, but you do for part two.

1. Often we need test-data for our applications. Implement a Java class that can provide random test data as sketched below:

String testdData = Generator.generate(100,1000);

This should return a JSON Array with 100 test data on the form:

```json
[{"fname": "Janne", "lname": "Peterson", "id": 1000, "age": 45},
{"fname": "Jan", "lname": "Olsen", "id": 1001, "age": 65},   
...
]
```
[see hint 1](#####hint-1)

*Rules for data generation:*

-   First number supplied to the method is the number of samples to generate
-   Id's starts with the number supplied as the second argument. Subsequent id's will be generated by incrementing this number with 1.
- Age is a number between 17-70 (both inclusive)

**2.** Implement a simple REST Service which, when called like this: GET:
http:/……/api/data/50/1

Should return a JSON array with 50 persons as sketched below:

```json
[

    {"fname": "Ole", "lname":"Hansen", "id":1, "age": 25},
    {"fname": "Peter", "lname":"Jensen", "id":2, "age": 35}
,...

]
```

**3.** Create a simple web page that, using React or plain **javascript,
renders a table** which should show test data fetched via the REST
method implemented in step 2.

##### hint-1: 
Include some hard coded arrays in your module like \["Ib", "Bo", "Lars", "Henrik"\] and pick a random value for each name you generate*
