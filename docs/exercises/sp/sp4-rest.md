[]{#_ps5ajfzbxzbb .anchor}Remember that exam preparation exercises
originally are meant to take about 80 minutes. As of now, you have two
hours preparation before the exam, so expect the final exercises to be a
bit more complex. Expect to talk about the “general part” in approx. 10
minutes.

effort with *all the exercises.*

[^1]: if (and only if) you do not complete the exam-prep problem, you
    may deploy any other problem instead, but prefer the REST\_JSON
    exam-prep problem, as it involves deploying both a webservice and a
    database.
