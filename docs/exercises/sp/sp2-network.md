# SP-2 Network, HTTP, Reverse Proxies and TLS'

**Note:**
There is no review next monday for these exercises. They are reviewed together with CA-1 on the following monday.

You must however add a link to the review document to a server with
information as requested in part-2 below.

### Part-1 (completing the daily exercises from the week)
[Day 1](../daily/NW_1_HTTP.md)   
[Day 2](../daily/NW_2_nginx.md)   

## Part-2

Host all exercises from [*Network and HTTP*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12oNatE_vXUsOc1-PWvl3ilD7adfZ1EOnC66S8825qF8/edit?usp=sharing) on your server, running on your domain name. Ensure that everything is accessible, *only via http**s***

Your site should have a front-page with a link to each of the exercises.
For those exercises where you were requested to “write down your
observations”, this text must be placed in a section together with the
link.

For the first exercise (Understanding Basic Network Terms like: IP,
TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP and more) you should add a specific page with your
answer to all the questions.

Add a page (plain html) which explains, as a minimum, the following for
your site: 
- What is the purpose on Nginx (a reverse proxy) as used in this week
- What is the purpose of a ssl-certificate, and for your certificate answer the following questions:
  - Who is your certificate issued to 
  - What is the expiry date for your certificate 
  - Who/what guarantees that your certificate is valid and not a certificate from a “man in the middle” What is the value of the public key, contained in your certificate
