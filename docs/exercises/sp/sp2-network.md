Note: 
------

There is no review next monday for these exercises. They are reviewed together with CA-1,October 3th.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must however add a link to the review document to a server with
information as requested in part-2 below.

Part-1 (completing the tasks from Tuesday - Thursday)
-----------------------------------------------------

A.  Make sure you have completed all exercises (relative to your
    > colour-ambition) from the exercise [*Network and
    > HTTP*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12oNatE_vXUsOc1-PWvl3ilD7adfZ1EOnC66S8825qF8/edit?usp=sharing).

B.  Setup your droplet(s) with your own domain name, Tomcat, MySQL,
    > Nginx and SSL as explained in this
    > [*document*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDjWf_Y39p9lLMRxUD1a_dg2DwwCYPhk0w2ryQFcnJw/edit?usp=sharing).

Part-2
------

Host all exercises from [*Network and
HTTP*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12oNatE_vXUsOc1-PWvl3ilD7adfZ1EOnC66S8825qF8/edit?usp=sharing)
on your server, running on your domain name. Ensure that everything is
accessible, *only via http**s***

Your site should have a front-page with a link to each of the exercises.
For those exercises where you were requested to “write down your
observations”, this text must be placed in a section together with the
link.

For the first exercise (Understanding Basic Network Terms like: IP,
TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP and more) you should add a specific page with your
answer to all the questions.

Add a page (plain html) which explains, as a minimum, the following for
your site.

-   What is the purpose on Nginx (a reverse proxy) as used in this week

-   What is the purpose of a ssl-certificate, and for your certificate
    > answer the following questions

    -   Who is your certificate issued to

    -   What is the expiry date for your certificate

    -   Who/what guarantees that your certificate is valid and not a
        > certificate from a “man in the middle”

    -   What is the value of the public key, contained in your
        > certificate
