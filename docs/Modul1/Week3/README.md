## Plan

### Day 1 - Introduction to JavaScript

### Day 2 - Document Object Model (DOM)

### Day 3-5 CA1

## Business competences

JavaScript is one of the most demanded programming skills. [ref: it.jobindex.dk](https://it.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?q=javascript&supid=1)

JavaScript this semester will provide students with the background to join modern front-end teams, using JS and supplementing JS frameworks/libraries.

## Exercises 
Day 1: [The JavaScript Array](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yen8XRTEXOFuHwglEF5IyhTZXJIPnkPt2kVsATwvdsM/edit) / [JavaScript Ex-1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OQM3BDIpTkzgXPKBjXyVYrFvLLLU28eGJIIAxG1U4dc/edit)

Day 2: [Dom Manipulation and Events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bF7L1TRPlBX2liOoTO9_O0mUE7YROr0dYyQifKYg0TA/edit)

Day 3-5: [CA1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gprgpuUTR3TmbiEKpLDDyN0id3gRB-X3V4S6GfP01FU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Resources: 

*There are tons of JavaScript articles on the Web. The two major resources are https://www.w3schools.com/ and MDN (Mozilla). Usually, articles from the first, are easier to read, more light weight, and often not quite as up to date as MDN. MDN should be considered the reference documentation.
Often when you google; articles from w3schools will pop up first. If you prefer MDN, add this to you search term, for example "javascript array MDN". If you prefer w3, where you often can try things out, do "javascript array w3".

**Important:** Don't always add W3 or MDN to your search queries, there are lots of other great sources out there.*

#### Our recommended resources for this week:
### Day-1 (plain JavaScript)
- The [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction) (Skip these sections: Regular expressions, Keyed collections, Details of the object model and the remaining sections) 
- [Course on Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Welcome/574716/612017-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a3%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3ajavascript%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) - section 1 - 4 + 9 (just skip sections you find to trivial)

### Day-2 (The Document Object Model - DOM)

- [W3Schools.com - HTML Document Object Model]( https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) Read/skim all chapters until and including DOM Event Listener. Complete as many of the examples/exercises as you have time for while you read.
- [Course on Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Welcome/574716/612017-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a3%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3ajavascript%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) chap 5-8 (chapter 6-8 will be a part of CA-1 so you can skip these sections until then)

### Extras:
This codecademy tutorial could be a good choice if you find that your general coding skills could be better.
Many of the sections require you to pay for the course, but it is definitely possible to go through with a free subscription (You are not expected to pay for this course):
